  - You're looking for decorations? I'd love to help, but I'm kind of busy right
    now.
  - I was doing some repairs on the house and lost sight of my younger brothers.
    Now, I have no idea where they are.
  - They're only 4 and 6 years old. They'll be fine if they stay inside the village...
    but if they leave...
  - I mean, you know what could happen to them. I'm starting to get real anxious
    over here.
  - 'Actually, could you help me look for them, Sable? '
  - I've already checked everything to the left of here. Why don't you head towards
    the right?
