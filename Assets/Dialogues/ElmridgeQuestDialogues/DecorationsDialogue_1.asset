  - Now that my family is safe- let's get to decorating!
  - I'll have this place looking spectacular for Du-Rah tonight. But I'll need...
    flowers.
  - And not just any flowers. I need Elmridge's most iconic flora--the Tangerine
    Flower.
  - They usually grow by the giant tree to the right of here. EagleEye is standing
