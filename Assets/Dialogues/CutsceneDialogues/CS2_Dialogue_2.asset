  - We're in the Elmridge Forests. Why'd you take me out here, Sheriff?
  - //Sheriff Brahm

  - I'm sure you've noticed it before, Sable.
  - The weather. It's been very strange lately. Over here, it's snowing, but over
    there--it's as warm as Spring.
  - It's almost as if two completely different seasons are happening simultaneously.
  - //Sable
  - '**3'
  - I have noticed that... it's been like this for a few weeks now. I never knew
    what to make of it.
  - //Sheriff Brahm
  - '**0'
  - Yes... I wasn't sure at first, but a phenomenon like this is certainly can not
    be explained by the laws of nature.
  - I fear that something beyond our knowledge may be happening--something that could
    lead to the destruction of everything.
  - //Sable
  - '**3'
  - What are you talking about?
  - //Sheriff Brahm
  - '**0'
  - There's an old prophecy that has been told in children's stories amongst goblins--you're
    probably too old to remember.
  - But it warns of us the day when the balance of the seasons are upset... it means
    the four dieties are at war.
  - When they're at war, the seasons could last for years--or just a couple of days.
    They could even never happen at all, or all at once. it all depends on the state
    of the dieties.
  - With the balance in shambles... our environment will collapse, and the world
    will fall to pieces soon enough.
  - But our prophecy declares there will be a hero... a goblin born that has the
    gift of uniting creatures of all races and ethnicities.
  - A goblin that will erase the scars between enemies and lead this continent to
    a solution.
  - //Sable
  - '**3'
  - ...I don't know what any of this means.
  - //Sheriff Brahm
  - '**0'
  - Neither do I. The prophecy mentions nothing about how to save this continent...
  - But there's one thing I'm sure of, Sable...
